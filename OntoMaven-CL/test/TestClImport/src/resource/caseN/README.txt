Case N. The last two of three importations import the same text into a nested domain restriction, wth different order of restriction.
The final importation is ignored because the order of restriction is not semantically-significant.

The directory /input holds the original corpus, with importations.
The directory /result holds a logically-equivalent corpus where all importations that are resolvable have been rewritten
in terms of XInclude statements.

We assume that all files at the top level (directly under /input or /result) constitute the corpus.
